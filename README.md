# Data-Encryption-using-AES
Developed a text encryption and decryption application  to secure our electronics data from hackers.


— The key is in the keyfile for Entryption and secryption.
— The plane text will converted into cipgher text. This cipher text is unreadble and stored in msg.aes file. 
- In decryption process read this cipher text from this msg.aes file and decrypted into the plane text(origional data) by
   using the 128-bit key
